## MOD GUIDE

Here's a guide to modding/learning off this datapack. Make 
sure you have read the pack license as well before modding
as it covers what you can and cant do relating to modding.



========= MAIN FOLDERS =========


| data/1_splatus

This is the main folder of the entire pack. 



| data/1_splatus/functions

Basically where all the code is stored, all
the main stuff. This is literally what makes
the datapack run. (Commands folder)






| data/1_splatus/functions/creatures/[insertmobname]

Each mob's own functions are stored in their folders



| data/1_splatus/functions/creatures/other/commands/

Also known as the "Common" folder for myself. These are 
commands that can basically be run by any entity, including
players! There's a folder inside thats has many of the mob
attacks, which you yourself can use





| data/minecraft

Modifies Minecraft assets



|



events.mcfunction - 

These files are the main mob folders. They 
contain other branching functions related to the mob
as well


spawning.mcfunction - 

Handle the spawning for each mob variant. If
two variants use the same mob as a base chances
are their spawning files are merged. Here
is also where their chances of spawning are
stored.



setup.mcfunction files - 

These run on every game tick, usually they 
check for when a mob exists or when to spawn one
